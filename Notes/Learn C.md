## Introduction

### About C Programming

- `C` is a low-level programming language. Low level in computers generally means a programming language that provides more control over hardware. Thus, similar things can be done in C.
- `C` was developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in 1972 at Bell Labs.
- `C` is a procedural programming language _(POP)_ & follows top-down ‚¨á approach while executing a program.

### Extra Info:

- `C++` is an object-oriented programming language _(OOP)_ & follows bottom-up ‚¨Ü approach while executing a program.

### Basic Structure of `C` Program

  

```
\#include<stdio.h> // Preprocessor Statement

int main() // main() is a function
{
    // Statements
    return 0;
}
```

  

`\#include<stdio.h>` is a preprocessor statement. In that `stdio.h` is a header file. Header files are predefined files that contain useful functions like `printf()` & `scanf()`.

### Hello World Program in `C`

  

- Example

```
\#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
```

  

- Run Code

[https://replit.com/@kunalshah017/Hello-World#Hello_World.c](https://replit.com/@kunalshah017/Hello-World#Hello_World.c)

`printf()` is a predefined function in `stdio.h` header file. It is used to print something on the screen.

### Comments in C

  

- Comments are used to make code more readable & understandable.
- Comments are not executed by the compiler.

  

```
// This is a single-line comment

/* This is a
   multi-line
   comment */
```
